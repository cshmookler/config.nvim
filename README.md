# **My Neovim Configuration**

This is my personal Neovim configuration. It includes syntax highlighting, autocompletion, code linting, git integration, filesystem integration, fuzzy finding, and other useful plugins.

I am refactoring this configuration in the 'refactor' branch.

## **Installation**

**1.** Install Neovim 9.x.

**2.** Clone this repository in your Neovim configuration directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cshmookler/config.nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
